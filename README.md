535 WebServer assignment

In this assignment, you will develop a simple Web server in Python that is capable of processing only one request. In our project, you will need to be able to support a request for HTML image content type in addition to the text content type. Then, you can submit the completed python program with a Word document to include some screen shots to demonstrate the behavior of your web server. You need to use this program to find out how many HTTP Request messages a browser will generate for an HTML file containing text and image files. You need to answer this question in your Word document.
